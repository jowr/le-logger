# Lange Eng Logger Visualization (le-logger)

A small Python app that digests logfiles from our Elitech GSP-6 temperature and humidity data logger. This project is about creating graphs and storing the data, no fancy processing required.

The idea is to have an app that can run on heroku.com and on pythonanywhere.com, but that has not been tested yet.
